/*
 * This is the Dutch National Flag algorithm.
 * A good way to intuitively understand this algo is to follow the following video
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp8JIuCXBaU
 * The algorithm has three basic rules, those being
 *
 * [0 .... low - 1] -> 0 (This is the extreme left)
 * [low .... mid - 1] -> 1
 * [high + 1 .... n - 1] -> 2 (This is the extreme right)
